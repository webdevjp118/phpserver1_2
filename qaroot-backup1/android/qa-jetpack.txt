Android Jetpack is a set of software components
 that help you accelerate your app development. 
These components provide a range of features, 
 including a new set of tools and libraries,
 that make it easier to develop high-quality apps.

Android Jetpack is a set of libraries, tools and guidance to help
 make it easier to write high-quality, robust, and maintainable apps.
One way it helps to reduce boilerplate code is by providing libraries
 that handle common tasks, such as navigation, lifecycle management,
 and data binding. 
This means that you don’t have to write as much code
 to handle these tasks yourself,
 which can help to reduce the amount of boilerplate in your app.

<hitle>	Jetpack- ViewModel	<chare>	1	<pext>	<starting>Jetpack- ViewModel</heading>
ViewModel is one of the most critical classes
 of the Android Jetpack Architecture Component that support data
 for UI components.
Its purpose is to hold and manage the UI-related data. 
Moreover, its main function is to maintain the integrity
 and allows data to be serviced during configuration changes
 like screen rotations. 
Any kind of configuration change in Android devices tends to recreate
 the whole activity of the application. 
It means the data will be lost if it has not been saved and restored properly
 from the activity which was destroyed. 
To avoid these issues, it is recommended to store all UI data in the ViewModel
 instead of an activity.

<hitle>	Jetpack- Room	<chare>	1	<pext>	<starting>Jetpack- Room</heading>
The requirement of a database in Android is fulfilled by SQLite
 from the very beginning. 
However, it comes with some severe drawbacks like not checking the queries
 at compile-time, it does not save POJOs. 
Developers also need to write a lot of boilerplate code 
to make the SQLite database. 
The Room component comes into the picture
 as an SQLite Object Mapping Library which overcomes
 all the mentioned challenges. 
Room converts queries directly into objects,
 checks errors in queries at the compile-time,
 and is also capable of persisting the Java POJOs. 
Moreover, it produces LiveData results/observables
 from the given query result. 
Because of this versatile nature of the Room component, 
Google officially supports and recommends developers to use it. 
The Room consists of sub-components:
1. Entity: It is the annotated class for which the Room creates a table
 within the database. 
The field of the class represents columns in the table.
2. DAO(Data Access Object): It is responsible for defining the methods
 to access the database and to perform operations.
3. Database: It is an abstract class that extends RoomDatabase class
 and it serves as the main access point to the underlying app’s relational data.

<hitle>	Jetpack- Data Binding	<chare>	1	<pext>	<starting>Jetpack- Data Binding</heading>
Data Binding library is a support library
 that provides the feature of binding UI components in an activity/fragment
 to the data sources of the application. 
The library carries out this binding task in a declarative format
 and not in a programmatic way. 
For example, in the past to find a TextView widget and bind it to
 the userName property of the ViewModel variable,
 the findViewById() method was called:
TextView textView = findViewById(R.id.sample_text);
textView.setText(viewModel.getUserName());
After using the Data Binding library, we can do it by using the assignment expression - @{}(At curly braces).
<TextView
 android:text=”@{viewmodel.userName}” />
****************************************
Advantages of Data Binding Component:
1. Make code simpler and easy to maintain by removing UI frameworks
 called in the activity.
2. Allows classes and methods to observe changes in data
3. Allows to make objects and fill which works as collection observables.

<hitle>	Jetpack- LiveData	<chare>	1	<pext>	<starting>Jetpack- LiveData</heading>
LiveData component is an observable data holder class
 i.e, the contained value can be observed. 
LiveData is a lifecycle-aware component and thus it performs its functions
 according to the lifecycle state of other application components. 
Further, if the observer’s lifecycle state is active 
i.e., either STARTED or RESUMED, 
only then LiveData updates the app component. 
LiveData always checks the observer’s state
 before making any update to ensure
 that the observer must be active to receive it. 
If the observer’s lifecycle state is destroyed, LiveData is capable of removing it,
 and thus it avoids memory leaks. 
It makes the task of data synchronization easier.
Advantages of LiveData component:
1. UI is updated as per the appropriate change in the data
2. It removes the stopped or destroyed activities
 which reduce the chance of app crash
3. No memory leaks as LiveData is a lifecycle-aware component.

<hitle>	Jetpack- Dagger	<chare>	1	<pext>	<starting>Jetpack- Dagger</heading>
Dagger is a Dependency Injection framework that will generate a lot of boilerplate code for you to achieve the goal of Dependency injection in Android development. Not that one must have a good understanding of Dependency Injection before answering this question. 

There are a number of reasons why you might want to use dagger to inject dependencies instead of injecting them manually. First, dagger can help to reduce the amount of boilerplate code that you need to write in order to inject dependencies. Second, dagger can help to improve the performance of your application by caching injected objects and avoiding repeated object creation. Finally, dagger can help to make your code more modular and easier to test by allowing you to easily swap out different implementations of injected dependencies.

<hitle>	Navigation component Jetpack	<chare>	1	<pext>	<starting>Navigation component Jetpack</heading>
The Navigation component is a Jetpack library
 that helps you manage fragment transactions
 and back stack management in your app. 
It also provides a way to create a consistent navigation UI across your app. 
The benefits of using the Navigation component include a simpler
 and more robust way to manage fragment transactions,
 as well as a more consistent navigation experience for users.

<hitle>	Lifecycles component Jetpack	<chare>	1	<pext>	<starting>Lifecycles component Jetpack</heading>
The Lifecycles component is designed to help manage the lifecycle
 of an Android app. 
It provides a number of features that can help to automate tasks
 and manage memory usage. 
For example, you can use the Lifecycles component
 to automatically start and stop services based on the lifecycle of your app.

<hitle>	Lifecycle Jetpack	<chare>	1	<pext>	<starting>Lifecycle Jetpack</heading>
Lifecycle is a class that holds the information
 about the lifecycle state of a component (like an activity or a fragment)
 and allows other objects to observe this state.
Lifecycle uses two main enumerations to track the lifecycle status
 for its associated component:
1. Event
The lifecycle events that are dispatched
 from the framework and the Lifecycle class. 
These events map to the callback events in activities and fragments.
2. State
The current state of the component tracked by the Lifecycle object.

<hitle>	Jetpack- inter-fragment communication	<chare>	1	<pext>	<starting>Jetpack- inter-fragment communication</heading>
There are two ways of implementing inter-fragment communication:
1. Using an interface: In this approach, you would create an interface
 in the parent fragment, and then have the child fragment
 implement that interface. 
The parent fragment can then call methods on the child fragment
 through the interface.
2. Using a ViewModel: With this approach, you would create a ViewModel
 that is shared between the parent and child fragments. 
The ViewModel can then be used to store data that needs to be shared
 between the fragments, and the fragments can observe changes
 to the ViewModel.

<hitle>	Workmanager pros Jetpack	<chare>	1	<pext>	<starting>Workmanager pros Jetpack</heading>
WorkManager is an Android Jetpack library
 that allows you to schedule and manage background tasks in your app. 
It is designed to be used with tasks that are not time-critical,
 and it provides a number of features that make it a good choice
 for managing background work in Android apps. 
WorkManager is flexible, allowing you to specify constraints
 on when your tasks should run,
 and it is also able to intelligently schedule tasks based on the state of the app
 and the device. 
WorkManager is also able to persist tasks across device reboots,
 and it integrates with other Android Jetpack libraries
 to provide a complete solution for background work in Android apps.

<hitle>	Paging Library Jetpack	<chare>	1	<pext>	<starting>Paging Library Jetpack</heading>
Paging Library makes it easier to load and display
 large datasets from a database or network asynchronously
 by providing a way to load data in small chunks (called “pages”). 
This way, only the data that is needed is loaded at any given time,
 which makes it more efficient
 and reduces the amount of time and resources
 required to load and display large datasets.
