<!-- 
At the beginning of each hand,
 Peter will be moved from your stack to the table.
The dealer will then distribute the hole cards.

After receiving your cards,
 you can either check or bet 4X Peter.
The dealer then reveals the flop.
If you haven't made a pre flop bet,
 you can now choose to check or bet twice Peter.
Next, the dealer reveals the turn and the river,
 giving you the option to bet 1X Peter or fold.

The dealer reveals their hand.
To qualify, the dealer needs a pair of 4's or better.
If the dealer does qualify,
 the Showdown Phase begins.
If the dealer fails to qualify,
 ante and play bets are pushed.

 The players then reveal their hands.
 If you managed to beat the dealer,
  your play bet is paid 1:1 and your ante is paid accordingto the strength of your hand.

The trips bet is an optional bet,
 which pays out if you hit three of a kind or better,
 regardless of whether or not the dealer has qualified.
The trips bet is paid according to the strength of your hand.
