<hitle>	tools and techniques cost/price paying	<chare>	1	<pext>	What are the tools and techniques that you can use in AWS to identify if you are paying more than you should be, and how to correct it?

We can check how mucy we are paying
 for the resources that we are using
 by employing the some of resources:
1. Check the Top Services Table
It is a dashboard in the cost management console
 that shows the top five most used services. 
This will let us know how much money we are spending
 on the resources in question.
2. Cost Explorer
There are cost explorer services available
 that will help us to view and analyze the usage costs
 for the last 13 months.
We can also get a cost forecast for the upcoming three months.
3. AWS Budgets

<hitle>	native AWS Security logging capability	<chare>	1	<pext>	What are the native AWS Security logging capabilities?

Most of the AWS services have their logging options. 
Also, some of them have an account level logging,
 like in AWS CloudTrail, AWS Config, and others. 

We can use two services in specific:
1. AWS CloudTrail
This is a service that provides a history of the AWS API calls
 for every account. 
It lets us perform security analysis, resource change tracking,
 and compliance auditing of your AWS environment as well. 
The best part about this service is that it enables to configure it
 to send notifications via AWS SNS when new logs are delivered.
2. AWS Config 
This helps us understand the configuration changes
 that happen in your environment. 
This service provides an AWS inventory
 that includes configuration history, configuration change notification,
 and relationships between AWS resources. 
It can also be configured to send information via AWS SNS
 when new logs are delivered.	</end>
<hitle>	DDoS attack service tool	<chare>	1	<pext>	What is a DDoS attack, and what services can minimize them?

<hitle>	immediately published service not see	<chare>	1	<pext>	You are trying to provide a service in a particular region, but you do not see the service in that region. Why is this happening, and how do you fix it?

Not all Amazon AWS services are available in all regions. 
When Amazon initially launches a new service,
 it doesn’t get immediately published in all the regions. 
They start small and then slowly expand to other regions. 
So, if we don’t see a specific service in the region,
 chances are the service hasn’t been published in your region yet. 
However, if we want to get the service that is not available,
 we can switch to the nearest region that provides the services.	</end>
<hitle>	monitor website metrics application status	<chare>	1	<pext>	How do you set up a system to monitor website metrics in real-time in AWS?

<hitle>	EC2 regions and availability zones	<chare>	1	<pext>	Define Amazon EC2 regions and availability zones?

Availability zones are geographically separate locations. 
As a result, failure in one zone has no effect on EC2 instances
 in other zones. 
When it comes to regions, they may have one or more availability zones. 
This configuration also helps to reduce latency and costs.	</end>
<hitle>	EC2 root device volume	<chare>	1	<pext>	Explain Amazon EC2 root device volume?

The image that will be used to boot an EC2 instance
 is stored on the root device drive. 
This occurs when an Amazon AMI runs a new EC2 instance. 
And this root device volume is supported by EBS or an instance store. 
In general, the root device data on Amazon EBS is not affected
 by the lifespan of an EC2 instance.	</end>

<hitle>	standby RDS same availability zone	<chare>	1	<pext>	Will your standby RDS be launched in the same availability zone as your primary?

No, standby instances are launched in different availability zones
 than the primary, resulting in physically separate infrastructures. 
This is because the entire purpose of standby instances
 is to prevent infrastructure failure. 
As a result, if the primary instance fails,
 the backup instance will assist in recovering all of the data.	</end>
<hitle>	Spot Instance vs an On-demand Instance vs Reserved Instance?	<chare>	1	<pext>	What is the difference between a Spot Instance, an On-demand Instance, and a Reserved Instance?

Spot instances are unused EC2 instances
 that users can use at a reduced cost.

When we use on-demand instances,
 we must pay for computing resources
 without making long-term obligations.

Reserved instances, on the other hand, allow to specify attributes
 such as instance type, platform, tenancy, region, and availability zone. 
Reserved instances offer significant reductions
 and capacity reservations
 when instances in certain availability zones are used.	</end>
<hitle>	relational database engine frequently collapses	<chare>	1	<pext>	How would you address a situation in which the relational database engine frequently collapses when traffic to your RDS instances increases, given that the RDS instance replica is not promoted as the master instance?

 as well as producing manual or automated snapshots
 to recover data if the RDS instance fails.	</end>
<hitle>	changing Amazon EC2	<chare>	1	<pext>	What do you understand by 'changing' in Amazon EC2?

To make limit administration easier for customers,
 Amazon EC2 now offers the option to switch
 from the current 'instance count-based limitations'
 to the new 'vCPU Based restrictions.' 
As a result, when launching a combination of instance types
 based on demand, utilization is measured
 in terms of the number of vCPUs.	</end>
<hitle>	Snapshots Amazon Lightsail	<chare>	1	<pext>	Define Snapshots in Amazon Lightsail?

The point-in-time backups of EC2 instances, block storage drives,
 and databases are known as snapshots. 
They can be produced manually or automatically at any moment. 
The resources can always be restored using snapshots,
 even after they have been created. 
These resources will also perform the same tasks as the original ones
 from which the snapshots were made.	</end>
<hitle>	CPU usage on your instance hits 80%	<chare>	1	<pext>	On an EC2 instance, an application of yours is active. Once the CPU usage on your instance hits 80%, you must reduce the load on it. What strategy do you use to complete the task?

It can be accomplished by setting up an autoscaling group
 to deploy additional instances,
 when an EC2 instance's CPU use surpasses 80%
 and by allocating traffic across instances via the creation
 of an application load balancer and the designation of EC2 instances
 as target instances.	</end>
<hitle>	AWS Auto Scaling groups	<chare>	1	<pext>	Multiple Linux Amazon EC2 instances running a web application for a firm are being used, and data is being stored on Amazon EBS volumes. The business is searching for a way to provide storage that complies with atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability while also increasing the application's resilience in the event of a breakdown (ACID). What steps should a solutions architect take to fulfill these demands?

AWS Auto Scaling groups can create an application load balancer
 that spans many availability zones. 
We need to mount a target on each instance and save data on Amazon EFS.	</end>

 and disabling password-based logins for instances
 launched from AMI.	</end>
<hitle>	S3 Used with EC2 Instances	<chare>	1	<pext>	Can S3 Be Used with EC2 Instances, and If Yes, How?

Amazon S3 can be used for instances with root devices
 backed by local instance storage.
That way, developers have access to the same highly scalable, reliable,
 fast, inexpensive data storage infrastructure that Amazon uses
 to run its own global network of websites. 
To execute systems in the Amazon EC2 environment,
 developers load Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) into Amazon S3
 and then move them between Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2.

Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 are two of the best-known web services
 that make up AWS.	</end>
<hitle>	stopping vs terminating an EC2 instance	<chare>	1	<pext>	What is the difference between stopping and terminating an EC2 instance? 

While we may think that both stopping and terminating are the same,
 there is a difference. 
When we stop an EC2 instance, it performs a normal shutdown
 on the instance and moves to a stopped state. 
However, when we terminate the instance, it is transferred
 to a stopped state, and the EBS volumes attached to it are deleted
 and can never be recovered.	</end>
<hitle>	types of EC2 instances	<chare>	1	<pext>	What are the different types of EC2 instances based on their costs?

The three types of EC2 instances are:

<hitle>	UpdatingRecords	<chare>	1	<pext>	What is Power User Access in AWS?
The AWS Resources owner is identical to an Administrator User. The Administrator User can build, change, delete, and inspect resources, as well as grant permissions to other AWS users.

Administrator Access without the ability to control users and permissions is provided to a Power User. A Power User Access user cannot provide permissions to other users but has the ability to modify, remove, view, and create resources.	</end>
<hitle>	UpdatingRecords	<chare>	1	<pext>	How is AWS CloudFormation different from AWS Elastic Beanstalk?
Here are some differences between AWS CloudFormation and AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

AWS CloudFormation helps you provision and describe all of the infrastructure resources that are present in your cloud environment. On the other hand, AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides an environment that makes it easy to deploy and run applications in the cloud.
AWS CloudFormation supports the infrastructure needs of various types of applications, like legacy applications and existing enterprise applications. On the other hand, AWS Elastic Beanstalk is combined with the developer tools to help you manage the lifecycle of your applications.	</end>
<hitle>	UpdatingRecords	<chare>	1	<pext>	What are the elements of an AWS CloudFormation template?
AWS CloudFormation templates are YAML or JSON formatted text files that are comprised of five essential elements, they are:

Template parameters
Output values
Data tables
Resources
File format version	</end>
<hitle>	UpdatingRecords	<chare>	1	<pext>	What happens when one of the resources in a stack cannot be created successfully?
If the resource in the stack cannot be created, then the CloudFormation automatically rolls back and terminates all the resources that were created in the CloudFormation template. This is a handy feature when you accidentally exceed your limit of Elastic IP addresses or don’t have access to an EC2 AMI.	</end>
<hitle>	UpdatingRecords	<chare>	1	<pext>	How can you automate EC2 backup using EBS?
Use the following steps in order to automate EC2 backup using EBS:

Get the list of instances and connect to AWS through API to list the Amazon EBS volumes that are attached locally to the instance.
List the snapshots of each volume, and assign a retention period of the snapshot. Later on, create a snapshot of each volume.
Make sure to remove the snapshot if it is older than the retention period.	</end>
<hitle>	UpdatingRecords	<chare>	1	<pext>	What is the difference between EBS and Instance Store?
EBS is a kind of permanent storage in which the data can be restored at a later point. When you save data in the EBS, it stays even after the lifetime of the EC2 instance. On the other hand, Instance Store is temporary storage that is physically attached to a host machine. With an Instance Store, you cannot detach one instance and attach it to another. Unlike in EBS, data in an Instance Store is lost if any instance is stopped or terminated.	</end>
<hitle>	UpdatingRecords	<chare>	1	<pext>	Can you take a backup of EFS like EBS, and if yes, how?
Yes, you can use the EFS-to-EFS backup solution to recover from unintended changes or deletion in Amazon EFS. Follow these steps:

Sign in to the AWS Management Console
Click the launch EFS-to-EFS-restore button
Use the region selector in the console navigation bar to select region
Verify if you have chosen the right template on the Select Template page
Assign a name to your solution stack
Review the parameters for the template and modify them if necessary	</end>
<hitle>	UpdatingRecords	<chare>	1	<pext>	How do you auto-delete old snapshots?
Here’s the procedure for auto-deleting old snapshots:

As per procedure and best practices, take snapshots of the EBS volumes on Amazon S3.
Use AWS Ops Automator to handle all the snapshots automatically.
This allows you to create, copy, and delete Amazon EBS snapshots.

<hitle>	Identity and Access Management (IAM)	<chare>	1	<pext>	What Is Identity and Access Management (IAM) and How Is It Used?

Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service
 for securely controlling access to AWS services. 
IAM lets us manage users, security credentials such as access keys,
 and permissions that control which AWS resources
 users and applications can access.	</end>
<hitle>	AWS WAF in monitoring	<chare>	1	<pext>	How can you use AWS WAF in monitoring your AWS applications?

AWS WAF or AWS Web Application Firewall protects
 our web applications from web exploitations. 
It helps control the traffic flow to your applications. 
With WAF, we can also create custom rules
 that block common attack patterns. 
It can be used for three cases:
 allow all requests, prevent all requests, and count all requests for a new policy.	</end>
<hitle>	different AWS IAM category	<chare>	1	<pext>	What are the different AWS IAM categories that you can control?

Using AWS IAM, we can:
1. Create and manage IAM users
2. Create and manage IAM groups
3. Manage the security credentials of the users
4. Create and manage policies to grant access
 to AWS services and resources	</end>
<hitle>	Policy user password	<chare>	1	<pext>	What are the policies that you can set for your users’ passwords?

There are some of the policies that we can set:
1. You can set a minimum length of the password,
 or you can ask the users to add at least one number
 or special characters in it.
2. You can assign requirements of particular character types,
 including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers,
 and non-alphanumeric characters.
3. You can enforce automatic password expiration,
 prevent reuse of old passwords, and request for a password reset
 upon their next AWS sign in.
4. You can have the AWS users contact an account administrator
 when the user has allowed the password to expire.	</end>
<hitle>	IAM role vs IAM user	<chare>	1	<pext>	What is the difference between an IAM role and an IAM user?

The two key differences between the IAM role and IAM user are:
1. An IAM role is an IAM entity that defines a set of permissions
 for making AWS service requests,
 while an IAM user has permanent long-term credentials
 and is used to interact with the AWS services directly.  
2. In the IAM role, trusted entities, like IAM users, applications,
 or an AWS service, assume roles whereas the IAM user
 has full access to all the AWS IAM functionalities.	</end>
<hitle>	managed policies in AWS IAM	<chare>	1	<pext>	What are the managed policies in AWS IAM?

There are two types of managed policies;
one that is managed by you and one that is managed by AWS. 
They are IAM resources that express permissions
 using IAM policy language. 
We can create, edit, and manage them separately
 from the IAM users, groups, and roles to which they are attached.	</end>
<hitle>	AWS IAM business	<chare>	1	<pext>	How does AWS IAM help your business?

IAM enables to:
Manage IAM users and their access –
 AWS IAM provides secure resource access to multiple users
Manage access for federated users –

 where DNS server requests are addressed.	</end>
<hitle>	Cloudtrail Route 53	<chare>	1	<pext>	What Is Cloudtrail and How Do Cloudtrail and Route 53 Work Together? 

CloudTrail is a service that captures information about
 every request sent to the Amazon Route 53 API by an AWS account,
 including requests that are sent by IAM users. 
CloudTrail saves log files of these requests to an Amazon S3 bucket. 
CloudTrail captures information about all requests. 
We can use information in the CloudTrail log files to determine
 which requests were sent to Amazon Route 53,
 the IP address that the request was sent from,
 who sent the request, when it was sent, and more.	</end>
<hitle>	Latency Based Routing vs Geo DNS	<chare>	1	<pext>	What is the difference between Latency Based Routing and Geo DNS?

The Geo Based DNS routing takes decisions based on
 the geographic location of the request. 
Whereas, the Latency Based Routing utilizes latency measurements
 between networks and AWS data centers. 
Latency Based Routing is used when we want to give our customers
 the lowest latency possible. 
On the other hand, Geo Based routing is used when we want
 to direct the customer to different websites based on the country
 or region they are browsing from.	</end>
<hitle>	Domain vs Hosted Zone	<chare>	1	<pext>	What is the difference between a Domain and a Hosted Zone?

1. Domain
A domain is a collection of data
 describing a self-contained administrative and technical unit. 
For example, www.simplilearn.com is a domain and a general DNS concept.
2. Hosted zone
A hosted zone is a container that holds information about
 how you want to route traffic on the internet for a specific domain. 
For example, lms.simplilearn.com is a hosted zone.	</end>
<hitle>	Amazon Route 53 high availability and low latency	<chare>	1	<pext>	How does Amazon Route 53 provide high availability and low latency?

Amazon Route 53 provides the resources in question:
1. Globally Distributed Servers
Amazon is a global service and consequently has DNS services globally.
Any customer creating a query from any part of the world
 gets to reach a DNS server local to them that provides low latency. 

2. Dependency
Route 53 provides a high level of dependability
 required by critical applications

3. Optimal Locations
Route 53 uses a global anycast network to answer queries
 from the optimal position automatically. 	</end>
<hitle>	AWS config with AWS CloudTrail	<chare>	1	<pext>	How does AWS config work with AWS CloudTrail?

AWS CloudTrail records user API activity on your account
 and allows to access information about the activity. 
Using CloudTrail, we can get full details about API actions such as
 the identity of the caller, time of the call, request parameters,
 and response elements. 
On the other hand, AWS Config records point-in-time configuration
 details for your AWS resources as Configuration Items (CIs). 

We can use a CI to ascertain what AWS resource looks like
 at any given point in time. 
Whereas, by using CloudTrail, we can quickly answer
 who made an API call to modify the resource. 
We can also use Cloud Trail to detect
 if a security group was incorrectly configured.	</end>
<hitle>	AWS Config aggregate data vs AWS accounts	<chare>	1	<pext>	Can AWS Config aggregate data across different AWS accounts?

Yes, we can set up AWS Config to deliver configuration updates
 from different accounts to one S3 bucket,
 once the appropriate IAM policies are applied to the S3 bucket.	</end>
<hitle>	reserved instances vs on-demand DB instances	<chare>	1	<pext>	How are reserved instances different from on-demand DB instances?

Reserved instances and on-demand instances are the same
 when it comes to function. They only differ in how they are billed.

Reserved instances are purchased as one-year or three-year reservations,
 and in return, you get very low hourly based pricing
 when compared to the on-demand cases that are billed on an hourly basis.	</end>
<hitle>	type of scaling RDS	<chare>	1	<pext>	Which type of scaling would you recommend for RDS and why?

There are two types of scaling - vertical scaling and horizontal scaling. 
Vertical scaling lets you vertically scale up your master database
 with the press of a button. 
A database can only be scaled vertically,
 and there are 18 different instances in which you can resize the RDS. 
On the other hand, horizontal scaling is good for replicas. 
These are read-only replicas that can only be done through Amazon Aurora.	</end>
<hitle>	RDS maintenance	<chare>	1	<pext>	What is a maintenance window in Amazon RDS? Will your DB instance be available during maintenance events?

RDS maintenance window lets you decide
 when DB instance modifications, database engine version upgrades,
 and software patching have to occur. 
The automatic scheduling is done only for patches that are related
 to security and durability. 
By default, there is a 30-minute value assigned
 as the maintenance window and the DB instance will still be available
 during these events though you might observe a minimal effect
 on performance.	</end>
<hitle>	consistency models DynamoDB	<chare>	1	<pext>	What are the consistency models in DynamoDB?

There are two consistency models In DynamoDB. 
First, there is the Eventual Consistency Model,
 which maximizes your read throughput. 
However, it might not reflect the results of a recently completed write. 
Fortunately, all the copies of data usually reach consistency
 within a second. 
The second model is called the Strong Consistency Model. 
This model has a delay in writing the data,
 but it guarantees that you will always see the updated data
 every time you read it.	</end>
<hitle>	type of query DynamoDB	<chare>	1	<pext>	What type of query functionality does DynamoDB support?
